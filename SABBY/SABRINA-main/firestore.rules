/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset is designed for the SportsCast platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model. It enforces strict user-ownership for all user-specific data,
 * ensuring that a user's profile and private data tree are accessible only to them. For globally shared content,
 * like videos, it employs a "Public Read, Owner-Only Write" model, allowing public consumption while restricting
 * modifications to the original creator.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into three top-level collections: /users, /videos, and /categories.
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains private user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/videos/{videoId}: A denormalized subcollection containing a user's own video metadata,
 *   enabling simple, path-based security checks for ownership.
 * - /videos/{videoId}: A global, public collection of all videos for easy discovery and viewing.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: A public, read-only collection for video categories.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * 1. User Privacy: User data is strictly private. Users cannot read other users' profiles, and user listing is disabled.
 * 2. Content Ownership: The `uploaderId` field on each video document is the source of truth for write permissions
 *    on the public `/videos` collection, preventing costly rule lookups.
 * 3. Read-Only Lookups: The `/categories` collection is publicly readable but cannot be modified by clients, ensuring
 *    data integrity. It is intended to be managed by administrators through the Firebase Console or a trusted server environment.
 * 4. Default Secure: Any operation not explicitly granted is denied. Write operations are never left open.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `uploaderId` is denormalized onto every document in `/videos`, making ownership checks fast and simple.
 * - The `/users/{userId}/videos` subcollection path is a form of denormalization, using the path itself as a
 *   key for ownership-based authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The dual video collections (`/videos` and `/users/{userId}/videos`) provide a clear separation between public-facing
 * data for querying and private, user-owned data for management, simplifying security logic for both.
